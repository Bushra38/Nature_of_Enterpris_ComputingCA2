# Nature of Enterprise Computing - CA2 Project

## Project Title
Powerlifting Performance Analysis & Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyses a powerlifting dataset using descriptive statistics, data visualisation, and a basic machine learning model. 

We use Linear Regression to predict total weight lifted based on performance variables such as squat, bench press, and deadlift.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Open Powerlifting dataset, containing over 200 rows and multiple numeric variables including:
- Squat (kg)
- Bench Press (kg)
- Deadlift (kg)
- Total (kg)
- Bodyweight (kg)
- Age

## Technologies Used
- Excel (Data cleaning & descriptive statistics)
- Python (Linear Regression model)
- HTML
- Bootstrap
- Chart.js
- GitHub Pages

## Machine Learning Model
We implemented a Linear Regression model to predict total weight lifted using selected numeric features.
