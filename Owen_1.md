# Powerlifting Performance Analysis & Prediction
## Brief
The project being done on Powerlifting analyzes a dataset using descriptive statistics, data visualisation and a basic machine learning approach.

## Descriptive Stats
The descriptive statistics provide a quick summary of the powerlifting datasets characteristics

- The mean shows the average performance
- The mode showing the most frequent occuring value
- The median giving the middle value
- The min and max values representing the performance ranges
- The standard deviation measuring how spread out the results are over the mean

Together, these stats give a clear overview of overall performance patterns and variability in the data.
