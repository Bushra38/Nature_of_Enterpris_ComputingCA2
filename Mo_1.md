# Powerlifting Performance Analysis Project 

# Overview 

Powerlifting is a strength sport consisting of three main lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. The total performance of an athlete is calculated as the sum of these three lifts. Using a dataset containing over 200 records of competitive lifters, we explored trends in performance, bodyweight, age, and gender differences. 

# Dataset Description

Bodyweight (kg)
