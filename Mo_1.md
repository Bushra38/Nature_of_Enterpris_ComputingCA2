# Powerlifting Performance Analysis Project 

# Overview 

Powerlifting is a strength sport consisting of three main lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. The total performance of an athlete is calculated as the sum of these three lifts. Using a dataset containing over 200 records of competitive lifters, we explored trends in performance, bodyweight, age, and gender differences. 

# Dataset Description 

The dataset contains records of competitive powerlifters and includes both numeric and categorical variables. Key numeric variables analysed in this project include: 

Age 

Bodyweight (kg) 

Squat (kg) 

Bench Press (kg) 

Deadlift (kg) 

Total Lift (kg) 

# Descriptive Statistics & Visualisation 

Descriptive statistics were calculated using Microsoft Excel, including: 

Mean 

Median 

Mode 

Minimum and Maximum values 

Standard Deviation 

Missing value counts 

Several charts were created to visualise trends and relationships within the data. These include: 

A scatter plot showing the relationship between bodyweight and total lift 

A bar chart comparing average total lift by gender 

A line chart showing performance trends over time 

The analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between bodyweight and total lift performance. Additionally, noticeable differences were observed between male and female performance averages, while performance trends showed gradual improvement over recent years. 

 

# Machine Learning Model 

A Linear Regression model was implemented to predict total lifting performance (TotalKg). The features used in the model included: 

Squat (kg) 

Bench Press (kg) 

Deadlift (kg) 

Bodyweight (kg) 

Age 

The model was evaluated using an R² score to measure performance. Results indicated a strong predictive relationship between the selected features and total lift performance. This demonstrates how basic machine learning techniques can be applied to sports data to generate predictive insights.
